Youtuber is a very lightweight YouTube plugin for WordPress designed to make the video's fit nicely in you blog.

== Description ==

Youtuber lets you embed YouTube videos in your posts very easily, and offers a few benefits over simply copying in YouTube's embed code.

1. Use simple 'tags' to place videos. This keeps your posts nice and tidy.
1. The plugin will replace the tags with valid XHTML code (unlike YouTube's default code).
1. Set the width and height of the videos once for all that are embedded in your blog (this can be used to make them fit in themes with a small content column, or be used to enlarge them). You can adust this if you switch theme.
1. If YouTube ever decides to alter their embed code, there will be no need for you to go through all your posts and update the code. Simply update this plugin and have the new code for all your movies.

Youtuber is very lightweight and should work with pretty much every version of WordPress (tested on 1.5 and higher).

== Installation ==

= Installation =
1. Download the zip file and extract the contents.
1. Upload the 'youtuber' folder to your plugins directory (wp-content/plugins/).
1. Activate the plugin through the 'plugins' page in WP.
1. See 'Settings->Youtuber' to adjust the display size.

= Using Youtuber to embed videos =
1. Find the video on YouTube, Vimeo o Google Video.
1. Extract the ID fromthe video page url. These look something like: http://youtube.com/watch?v=**Krhl2o_uwdc**. The bit I put in bold type is the ID.
1. Type [youtube]**Krhl2o_uwdc**[/youtube] anywhere in your post. User [viemo] o [googlevideo] if the video is from other source.
1. Save and publish the post.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is this plugin better than other YouTube plugins? =
It's not. Most other plugins have more features. Youtuber's main strength is that it's very simple to use and very low on resources. If you need none of the features that the competition offers, this plugin just might be ideal for you.
